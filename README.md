# AI Email Spam Detection Portfolio

This is an AI Email Spam Detection project. This repository showcases a full-stack website that uses machine learning and cloud technologies to classify emails as spam or not. The project includes model development with TensorFlow, containerization with Docker, deployment on Google Cloud, and a Python Flask web interface that interacts with the TensorFlow Serving API.

## Technologies
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building, training, and optimizing the spam detection model.
- **Docker**: Employed to containerize the TensorFlow Serving environment for scalable deployment.
- **Google Cloud**: Provides the infrastructure for hosting the Docker container and serving the model.
- **TensorFlow Serving**: Manages the model deployment, allowing efficient inference at scale.
- **Python Flask**: Serves as the front-end web framework to access the Google Cloud API and interact with the model.
